<h4>Warning Tags</h4>

<p>
  The Enderwalk Archives have chosen, for legal and other reasons, to mandate
  that users either warn for&mdash;or explicitly choose not to warn for&mdash;a
  short list of common warnings. We understand that creators may wish to not
  warn for some of these things, or to warn for additional content, and have
  provided options for them to do so within this framework.

    for certain topics or warnings in general; if you want to avoid some
    spoilers, but not others; etc.
